# fatebot
A Discord bot written in Python to facilitate games in the roleplaying system Fate Core. 

At the time I started this project, I was GMing a lot of Fate Core. I found it annoying to have to have a desktop open for Discord (my group's platform of choice), a dekstop for the rulebook and a browser tab for character sheets and other miscellanea. So I decided to build a bot which would take care of some basic Fate Core functions, such as rolling dice, keeping track of character sheets and initiative. The objective was to make my life as a GM somewhat easier. 

The bot supports one game per Discord channel, meaning I don't have to create an entirely new server to play with my friends if I don't want to. It also supports offline storage of games, because I haven't decided if I want to keep the bot up 24/7 yet. Information about games is stored in a text file on my Google Drive for now, because that seems fine to me for a small number of them.
